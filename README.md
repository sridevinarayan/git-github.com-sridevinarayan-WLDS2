# WLDS
# Steps:
<!-- #   1. Prep.ipynb - to figure out which features need to be extracted. Experiements are done with several parameters
        a) On one sample hardcoded data file, data_21_FD.wav, extract different features
        b) MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), Zero-crossing rate, Energy, Spectral-roll off, Spectral entropy  -->
        <!-- 2. Features.ipynb - to create a dataset by extracting features of the audio files (.WAV)
            a) Each audio file is manually labelled (filename) on what the file is
            b) all the files are read and features extracted and saved in a dataset.  -->
            c)Output: out_file_path = '/Users/ns/development/iisc/WLDS2/data/out/dataset_1.csv'
